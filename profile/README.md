Fastbolt was established in 1982 as a range specialist, providing industrial fasteners to European distributors. The keystones of our business are consistent high product quality coupled with unsurpassed service and competitive pricing. Our strength of co-operation with both customers and suppliers has provided a strong foundation for steady growth.

With locations in Germany, England, Portugal and China we provide close proximity to our customers and maintain a permanent geographical presence in the ever changing and constantly growing supply markets in Asia.

Constant scrutiny and improvements of our internal processes and procedures, and the use of state-of-the-art equipment, are key factors in our sales philosophy that provides measurable added value to our customers.
